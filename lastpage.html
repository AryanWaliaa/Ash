        <br>Well, if I recall correctly, you told me that the t-shirt would be a goodbye gift from your side. this whole thing is not a goodbye message because "goodbye" is not a thing for me. I guess, yes, yes, filmy :) thanks for listening my lame school stories. Yours were too interesting. I remember all of your stories because you were part of those stories. I will have your image imprinted in my mind: in a white top with specs on, streaming with a lollipop, and the first photo of yours that you shared with me; your eyes are as deep as the Pacific Ocean. (I sang it in a pitched voice while typing this).

 Remember us saying "goodnight" in the mornings? You made me laugh so many times. Your smile made me smile. And yes, I still do that wind thing with my hair. I just realized, I guess that's a habit now. :( But one thing is for sure, a time machine won't be invented in the next 50 years because I would have changed things by now to make this smooth. :) i told you i will be cringe.

And yes, all the songs I shared with you might not connect or relate, but they do in my mind because I can't stop thinking about us and creating good scenarios. Butttt no, nobody else is touching you anywhere

And yes, I wasn't able to answer your scenarios, but I will do anything to prevent anyone else from touching you.  but I will have regrets all my life for not doing things rather than doing something i meant this im not saying this to youknow. If you're reading this on 4-5 July, it's been more than three months, but you have become important to me. now what should i do to make thiss specialllllllllllll im dumbbb i want help  </p>

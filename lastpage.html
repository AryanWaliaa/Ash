        <br>Well, if I recall correctly, you told me that the t-shirt would be a goodbye gift from your side. See, I'm not good with words, not as good as you at least, but this whole thing is not a goodbye message because "goodbye" is not a thing for me. I guess, yes, yes, filmy :) thanks for listening my lame school stories. Yours were too interesting. I remember all of your stories because you were part of those stories. I will have your image imprinted in my mind: in a white top with specs on, streaming with a lollipop, and the first photo of yours that you shared with me; your eyes are as deep as the Pacific Ocean. (I sang it in a pitched voice while typing this).

Also, I never directly told you, but you were the one who helped Gopika, not me. And you didn't back out. Well, that's good for me. Remember us saying "goodnight" in the mornings? You made me laugh so many times. Your smile made me smile. And yes, I still do that wind thing with my hair. I just realized, I guess that's a habit now. :( But one thing is for sure, a time machine won't be invented in the next 50 years because I would have changed things by now to make this smooth. :) i told you i will be cringe.

And yes, all the songs I shared with you might not connect or relate, but they do in my mind because I can't stop thinking about us and creating good scenarios. But no, nobody else is touching you anywhere; I'm the only one tasting chocochops.

And yes, I wasn't able to answer your scenarios, but I will do anything to prevent anyone else from touching you. I know you think of me as innocent, but I will have regrets all my life for not doing things rather than doing something i meant this im not saying this to youknow. If you're reading this on 4-5 July, it's been more than three months, but you have become important to me. now what should i do to make thiss specialllllllllllll im dumbbb i want help  </p>
